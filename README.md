# Echo Server and Client
Program that utilizes TCP socket programming to create a simple reverse echo server and client that communicate.

# Reverse Echo Server
The echo server recieves messages from the client, reverses it, and sends the message back to the client.

The server program is terminated when it recieves the message "end" from the client.



# Echo Client
The echo client allows for a user to send messages to the server, which are then reversed by the server and sent back to the client.

When the user types "end" to send to the server, "dne" is sent back and the client terminates.
